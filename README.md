### Tutorials/Assistance

This wouldn't have been possible for me to learn without the help of the incredible tutorial series by CouchFerret, [available here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM83Z6G5iM3k48356VU6e-oXWl_uwwq4F).

Also, big thanks top DuckDuckGo and the general existence of the Internet.
